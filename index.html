            <h3>Web <span>Developer</span></h3>
            <p>Hi, I'm <span>Jeffrey Lozada</span>, a web developer from CvSU Bacoor with a passion for building functional and user-friendly websites. I graduated from San Nicolas 3 Senior High School, specializing in ICT Programming, where I developed a strong foundation in coding and problem-solving.

                While I’m still growing my skills in front-end development, I enjoy working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create simple yet effective designs. I also have experience with back-end technologies like Node.js and databases, allowing me to build structured and efficient web applications. I'm always eager to learn and improve, exploring new technologies to enhance my work.
                
                If you're looking for a dedicated developer who’s always striving to improve and deliver clean, functional websites, I’d love to collaborate and help bring your ideas to life. Let’s work together and build something great!</p>
